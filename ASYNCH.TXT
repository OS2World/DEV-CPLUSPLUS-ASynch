The files ASYNCH.H and ASYNCH.CPP are the actual source code to the
asynchronous object class.  The file SPDTERM.CPP is merely a sample
test program to test the interrupt and some of the functions of the
class.  To compile, simply create a .PRJ file by loading up TC++,
and create a project file with the items ASYNCH.CPP and SPDTERM.CPP.
From command line, just make sure you link in the ASYNCH.OBJ with
the SPDTERM.OBJ.
Have fun.
